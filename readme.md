_Obsessed with Reality_ is a personal project dedicated to inspiring curiosity in the natural world.

The site serves as a wiki with a focus on Women in STEM fields. Users can sign in and apply for admin access, where they can collaborate to create new posts, as well as edit existing ones.

### Technologies Used

The site was created using node/express and PostgreSQL for database management.

The site relies on three databases:
1. a database for users, where some are given admin access
2. a database for newsletter subscribers
3. a database for content posts_id

### Project Outline

The site was designed as a wiki, where collaborators can create, edit, update, and delete content. I wanted to make the site visually impactful, and easy to add new content.

Some features I was hoping to include were creating user profiles that capture a log of individual user edits, and a search feature to sort through all posts. While these additions did not make the first deployment, they will be incorporated in the next phase of the site. I see this project as something that will be continuously evolving, and plan on adding new features as my skills continue to grow.
